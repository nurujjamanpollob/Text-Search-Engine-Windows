# Text-Search-Engine-Windows


This project is a powerful, intuitive tool designed to help developers and users manage and modify files across their systems. It combines system-wide text searching with the advanced capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to perform complex file modifications from a user-friendly interface. Best of all, it's completely free to use.

<h3>Features</h3>
System-wide Text Matching: Efficiently search for specific text strings or patterns within any file on your system.

Smart LLM Integration: Connect to a powerful LLM to understand and interpret your modification requests.

Intuitive Interface: A clean, easy-to-use interface allows you to define your desired changes without writing complex scripts.

Intelligent File Modification: The LLM analyzes your request, identifies the relevant files from the text search, and makes the necessary modifications, all based on natural language instructions.

Free and Open-Source: Access all features for free, with the potential for community contributions to enhance functionality.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

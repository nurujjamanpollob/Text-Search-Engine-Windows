# Text-Search-Engine-Windows

 <p>
        This project is a powerful, intuitive tool designed to help developers and users manage and modify files across their systems. It combines system-wide text searching with the advanced capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to perform complex file modifications from a user-friendly interface. Best of all, it's completely free to use.
    </p>

<h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>System-wide Text Matching:</strong> Efficiently search for specific text strings or patterns within any file on your system.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart LLM Integration:</strong> Connect to a powerful LLM to understand and interpret your modification requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Intuitive Interface:</strong> A clean, easy-to-use interface allows you to define your desired changes without writing complex scripts.</li>
        <li><strong>Intelligent File Modification:</strong> The LLM analyzes your request, identifies the relevant files from the text search, and makes the necessary modifications, all based on natural language instructions.</li>
     <li><strong>Work as a project:</strong> Open a folder as a project, edit files with AI inline code suggestion, ship faster</li>
     <li><strong>Works completely offline:</strong> This editor can work without any activation or internet access, so you can build with confidence and privacy</li>
        <li><strong>Free and Open-Source:</strong> Access all features for free, with the potential for community contributions to enhance functionality.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
        Download the Windows Installer from the <a href="https://github.com/nurujjamanpollob/Text-Search-Engine-Windows/releases">release page</a>. This application requires TCP port 8080 to be free to run the file management server.
    </p>
    <p>
        To use the AI functionality, you'll need to install <a href="https://lmstudio.ai/">LM Studio</a>. Once installed, enable the API function and don't forget to enable CORS settings from the API settings.
    </p>

  <p>Enjoy!</p>
